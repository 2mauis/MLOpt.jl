This repository collects the code used in my blog series about *Optimization and Machine Learning*. (TODO: give the link)

The code is written in [julia](http://julialang.org/), primarily for the purpose of demonstrating basic machine learning models and optimization algorithms. In order to make the code clear, efficiency is **not** of a primary concern here. Directly using this code in production is **not** recommended.
