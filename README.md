This repository collects the code used in my [blog series about Optimization and Machine Learning](http://freemind.pluskid.org/series/mlopt/).

The code is written in [julia](http://julialang.org/), primarily for the purpose of demonstrating basic machine learning models and optimization algorithms. In order to make the code clear, efficiency is **not** of a primary concern here. Directly using this code in production is **not** recommended.

Since this code might be evolving, I will make a tag when each blog post is published, so that one can always check out the old version and reproduce what is described in the blog post even if the structure or the behavior of the code change in future versions.
